## Introduction

TMT-based quantative proteomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma clinical samples, including three paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues.

![Relative variation statistics for cutoff threshold setting.](res/rel.var_bar_pub.jpeg)

Based on the 88% coverage requirement for biological replicates experiment, the cutoff threshold should be set at `r fc_cut`.

## Diffentially expressed proteins

## GSEA enrichment analysis
The GSEA enriched signatures were listed in file "gsea_c5_sort.xlsx".
The top three enriched signatures were showed in figure below.
