Based on the 88% coverage requirement for biological replicates experiment, the cutoff threshold should be set at 1.5.

## Diffentially expressed proteins

## GSEA enrichment analysis
The GSEA enriched signatures were listed in file "gsea_c5_sort.xlsx".
The top three enriched signatures were showed in figure below.
