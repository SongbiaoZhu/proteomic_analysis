Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. In elongating Pol II, the lid loop (RPB1) appears to act as a wedge to drive apart the DNA and RNA strands at the upstream end of the transcription bubble and guide the RNA strand toward the RNA exit groove located near the base of the largely unstructured CTD domain of RPB1. The rudder loop (RPB1) interacts with single-stranded DNA after separation from the RNA strand, likely preventing reassociation with the exiting RNA. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw, formed by RPB5 and portions of RBP1. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template, mainly by RPB5 direct contacts to DNA."

Acts in concert with a poly(A)-specific nuclease (PAN) to affect poly(A) tail shortening, which may occur concomitantly with either nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport or translational initiation. Regulates PAN activity via interaction with the stimulator PAN3 or the inhibitor PBP1. In the cytoplasm, affects both translation and mRNA decay. Stimulates translation by interaction with translation initiation factor eIF4G, a subunit of the cap-binding complex eIF4F, bringing the 5'- and 3'-ends of the mRNA in proximity. The formation of this circular mRNP structure appears to be critical for the synergistic effects of the cap and the poly(A) tail in facilitating translation initiation, recycling of ribosomes, and mRNA stability. Also regulates translation termination by recruiting eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3). Interaction with eRF3 is also required for regulation of normal mRNA decay through translation termination-coupled poly(A) shortening, probably mediated by PAN. Loss of PAB1 from the mRNP after deadenylation triggers mRNA degradation. Inhibits the major cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase CCR4-NOT complex.

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes.

It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SPT3 is required for recruitment of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to SAGA-dependent promoters. During SAGA-mediated transcriptional inhibition, SPT3 and SPT8 prevent binding of TBP to the TATA box. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus. SPT factors 3, 7 and 8 are required for the initiation of Ty transcription from the delta promoter.

Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center.

Binding of alpha-factor or a-factor to its cognate transmembrane receptor STE2 and STE3, respectively, allows the receptor to serve as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) on GPA1. The exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein alpha subunit alters its interaction with the G protein beta subunit STE4, leading to dissociation of the G protein beta-gamma dimer STE4-STE18. The dissociated subunits activate downstream effectors to activate the mating response pathway and induce changes necessary to produce mating-competent cells. STE4-STE18 activate the downstream pheromone signaling MAP kinase cascade leading to expression of mating-specific genes, inducing cell cycle arrest in G1, promoting polarized cell growth to form mating projections (shmoos), and establishing the changes in plasma membrane, cell wall and nuclear envelope to permit cell-cell fusion (plasmogamy) and fusion of the two haploid nuclei (karyogamy). GPA1 transmits a signal that requires direct binding to the effector enzyme PI3K located at the endosome, promoting increased PI3 production. The intrinsic GTPase activity of GPA1 determines the duration of signaling, and is dramatically accelerated by the RGS protein SST2. In unstimulated cells, GDP-bound GPA1 sequesters the G protein beta-gamma subunit STE4-STE18, preventing it from activating the downstream effectors.

Non-activated KSS1 has a kinase-independent repressive effect on STE12 transcriptional activity, that is mediated by direct binding to STE12 and depends on the presence of DIG1 and DIG2, and that is required for the suppression of filamentation under normal growth conditions. SSN3/SRB10 contributes further to the suppression of filamentation under these conditions by reducing STE12 stability independent of KSS1. FUS3 can partially compensate for the lack of KSS1 but filamentation becomes constitutively induced at a low level in the absence of any signal. KSS1 phosphorylates STE7, STE5, FAR1, DIG1, DIG2, STE12, and SST2. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11583629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12520306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12732146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21460040, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8918885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9393860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9744865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9860980}."

ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:6363386, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

Acts mainly to repair insertion-deletion loops (IDLs) from 2 to 13 nucleotides in size, but can also repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with either the MutL alpha or MutL beta heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. MutS beta also has a role in regulation of heteroduplex formation during mitotic and meiotic recombination. MutS beta binds to DNA flap structures predicted to form during recombination, and is required for 3' non-homologous tail removal (NHTR).

ERG4 Catalyzes the last step of ergosterol biosynthesis by converting ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol into ergosterol (PubMed:10722850, PubMed:12882006). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25.

The septins at the bud neck serve as a structural scaffold that recruits different components involved in diverse processes at specific stages during the cell cycle. Many proteins bind asymmetrically to the septin collar. The septin assembly is regulated by protein kinases GIN4 and/or CLA4.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), which bind to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH2 seems to act as a scaffold for the other MutS homologs that provide substrate-binding and substrate specificity. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shield approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha acts mainly to repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication, but can also repair longer insertion-deletion loops (IDLs), although with decreasing efficiency as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. MutS beta acts mainly to repair IDLs from 2 to 13 nucleotides in size, but can also repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta form a ternary complex with a MutL heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. Both subunits bind ATP, but with differing affinities, and their ATPase kinetics are also very different. MSH6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, whereas MSH2 catalyzes ATP at a substantially slower rate. Binding to a mismatched base pair suppresses MSH6-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, but not the activity of MSH2. ATP binding to both subunits is necessary to trigger a change in MutS alpha interaction with mismatched DNA, converting MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent movement along DNA, and also facilitates formation of ternary complexes containing MutS and MutL proteins and the mismatch. MutS beta also has a role in regulation of heteroduplex formation during mitotic and meiotic recombination. MutS beta binds to DNA flap structures predicted to form during recombination, and is required for 3' non-homologous tail removal (NHTR). MutS beta-binding alters the DNA conformation of its substrate at the ds/ssDNA junction and may facilitate its recognition and/or cleavage by the downstream nucleotide excision repair (NER) RAD1-RAD10 endonuclease. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10518225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12820877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12875840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15811858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16214425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16337600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16600868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16781730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17636021, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8600025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9111357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9256462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9368761, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9545323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9770499}."

Most of the produced acetaldehyde is subsequently reduced to ethanol, but some is required for cytosolic acetyl-CoA production for biosynthetic pathways. The enzyme is also one of five 2-oxo acid decarboxylases (PDC1, PDC5, PDC6, ARO10, and THI3) able to decarboxylate more complex 2-oxo acids (alpha-keto-acids) than pyruvate, which seem mainly involved in amino acid catabolism. Here the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of amino acids, which, in a first step, have been transaminated to the corresponding 2-oxo acids.

ERG9 produces squalene from 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1807826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2068081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8323279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9742963, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

The source of acetyl-CoA being either peroxisomal when breaking down fatty acids, or cytosolic when extra-cellular two-carbon substrates are used, therefore, although not strictly essential, the peroxisomal localization of MLS1 appears to be advantageous for cells growing on oleic acid, in that acetyl-CoA production and utilization are thereby intimately compartmentalized together to increase efficiency (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11846793, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1454530, ECO:0000305|PubMed:1454530}."

ERG3 catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1864507, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:1418625, PubMed:8125337). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1418625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8125337, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

This collar persists until just before cytokinesis, when it splits into two rings that occupy opposite sides of the neck. The septins at the bud neck serve as a structural scaffold that recruits different components involved in diverse processes at specific stages during the cell cycle. Many proteins bind asymmetrically to the septin collar. The septin assembly is regulated by protein kinases GIN4 and/or CLA4. May act by recruiting MYO1 and HOF1, a protein involved in septation, to the site of cleavage. Septins are also involved in cell morphogenesis, bud site selection, chitin deposition, cell cycle regulation, cell compartmentalization and spore wall formation."

ERG1 catalyzes the epoxidation of squalene into 2,3-epoxysqualene (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1743514, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8358382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9450962, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

The 43S PIC binds to mRNA and scans downstream to the initiation codon, where it forms a 48S initiation complex by codon-anticodon base pairing. This leads to the displacement of eIF-1 to allow GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF-5-mediated hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP. Hydrolysis of GTP and release of Pi, which makes GTP hydrolysis irreversible, causes the release of the eIF-2-GDP binary complex from the 40S subunit, an event that is essential for the subsequent joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form an elongation-competent 80S ribosome.

Active directional transport is assured by both, a Phe-Gly (FG) repeat affinity gradient for these transport factors across the NPC and a transport cofactor concentration gradient across the nuclear envelope (GSP1 and GSP2 GTPases associated predominantly with GTP in the nucleus, with GDP in the cytoplasm). As one of the FG repeat nucleoporins NUP2 is involved in interactions with and guidance of nuclear transport receptors such as SRP1-KAP95 (importin alpha and beta) through the NPC. Like the closely related NUP1 it also plays an important role in disassembling and recycling SRP1-KAP95 to the cytoplasm after nuclear import. Upon entry of the heterotrimeric SRP1-KAP95-cargo complex in the nucleus, NUP2 binds through its N-terminus to the SRP1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) binding site, thus accelerating the release of the NLS-cargo. SRP1 in turn is released from NUP2 by binding of the GSP1-GTP associated export factor CSE1. NUP2 may also have a chromatin boundary/insulator activity through indirect interaction with genomic DNA via CSE1 and blocking of heterochromatin spreading. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10684247, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11046143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387327, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11425876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11535617, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11867631, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12062099, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12372823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12543930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12604785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12917401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14514698, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15039779}."

It recognizes H3K4me. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus.

The STUbL complex SLX5/SLX8 stimulates ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, including UBC1, UBC4, UBC5 and UBC13-MMS2, and mediates the proteolytic down-regulation of sumoylated proteins (PubMed:18032921). The STUbL complex SLX5/SLX8 is involved in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of histone variant CSE4, preventing mislocalization to euchromatin (PubMed:26960795). The complex plays an essential role in maintenance of chromosome stability and links SUMO-dependent ubiquitination to a centromere-specific function during mitosis (PubMed:23785440). The complex is involved in proteolysis of spindle positioning protein KAR9 and ensures correct spindle function by regulating levels of microtubule-associated proteins (PubMed:26906737). During replication, the complex helps prevent DNA lesions via recombination and has a role in localizing the DNA damage protein DCD2 (PubMed:16325482, PubMed:17591698). The complex especially ubiquitinates the nuclease YEN1 and prevents persistent accumulation of a fraction of YEN1 associated with sites of activity in late G2/M and helps maintain the balance between pro- and anti-crossover pathways during homologous recombination (PubMed:30479332). It is also involved in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of DNA repair proteins RAD52 and RAD57 (PubMed:18032921). Along with SIR2, promotes silencing of genes at telomeric or ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci (PubMed:18086879).

In early mitosis, the APC/C is activated by CDC20 and targets securin PDS1, the B-type cyclin CLB5, and other anaphase inhibitory proteins for proteolysis, thereby triggering the separation of sister chromatids at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. In late mitosis and in G1, degradation of CLB5 allows activation of the APC/C by CDH1, which is needed to destroy CDC20 and the B-type cyclin CLB2 to allow exit from mitosis and creating the low CDK state necessary for cytokinesis and for reforming prereplicative complexes in G1 prior to another round of replication. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10871279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15060174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7925276}."

TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12842197, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16235265, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1731628, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8).

The sequential action of ESCRT-0, -I, and -II together with the ordered assembly of ESCRT-III links membrane invagination to cargo sorting (PubMed:12194857). Membrane scission in the neck of the growing vesicle releases mature, cargo-laden ILVs into the lumen (PubMed:24139821, PubMed:24711499). ESCRT-III is critical for late steps in MVB sorting, such as membrane invagination and final cargo sorting and recruitment of late-acting components of the sorting machinery (PubMed:24139821, PubMed:24711499). SNF7 is the most abundant ESCRT-III subunit which forms membrane-sculpting filaments with 30 Angstrom periodicity and a exposed cationic membrane-binding surface (PubMed:26670543). Its activation requires a prominent conformational rearrangement to expose protein-membrane and protein-protein interfaces (PubMed:26670543). SNF7 filaments then form spirals that could function as spiral springs (PubMed:26522593). The elastic expansion of compressed SNF7 spirals generates an area difference between the two sides of the membrane and thus curvature which could be the origin of membrane deformation leading eventually to fission (PubMed:26522593). SNF7 recruits BRO1, which in turn recruits DOA4, which deubiquitinates cargos before their enclosure within MVB vesicles (PubMed:11029042, PubMed:15935782). ESCRT-III is also recruited to the nuclear envelope (NE) by integral INM proteins to surveil and clear defective nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly intermediates to ensure the fidelity of NPC assembly (PubMed:25303532). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11559748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12194857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15935782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24139821, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24711499, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25303532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26522593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3062374}."

VTC exposes its catalytic domain VTC4 to the cytosol, where the growing polyP chain winds through a tunnel-shaped pocket, integrating cytoplasmic polymer synthesis with polyP membrane translocation (PubMed:19390046). The VTC complex carries 9 vacuolar transmembrane domains, which are likely to constitute the translocation channel into the organelle lumen (PubMed:25315834, PubMed:19390046). PolyP synthesis is tightly coupled to its transport into the vacuole lumen, in order to avoid otherwise toxic intermediates in the cytosol, and it depends on the proton gradient across the membrane, formed by V-ATPase (PubMed:25315834).

The VTC complex acts as vacuolar polyphosphate polymerase that catalyzes the synthesis of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) via transfer of phosphate from ATP to a growing polyP chain, releasing ADP. VTC exposes its catalytic domain VTC4 to the cytosol, where the growing polyP chain winds through a tunnel-shaped pocket, integrating cytoplasmic polymer synthesis with polyP membrane translocation (PubMed:19390046). The VTC complex carries 9 vacuolar transmembrane domains, which are likely to constitute the translocation channel into the organelle lumen (PubMed:25315834, PubMed:19390046). PolyP synthesis is tightly coupled to its transport into the vacuole lumen, in order to avoid otherwise toxic intermediates in the cytosol, and it depends on the proton gradient across the membrane, formed by V-ATPase (PubMed:25315834).

TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs).

ERG25 is a catalytic component of the C-4 demethylation complex that catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols (PubMed:8552601, PubMed:12880870). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12880870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29773647, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8552601, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

ERG26 is a catalytic component of the C-4 demethylation complex that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group (PubMed:9811880). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15995173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9811880, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

ERG5 converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8635732, PubMed:8543054). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8543054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8635732, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

Acetylation of histones gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation and elongation (PubMed:10026213, PubMed:11545749, PubMed:16543222, PubMed:16543223, PubMed:17189264, PubMed:19822662). Operates in concert with certain DNA-binding transcriptional activators such as GCN4 or HAP2/3/4 (PubMed:10026213, PubMed:11545749, PubMed:16543222, PubMed:16543223, PubMed:17189264). Its acetyltransferase activity seems to be dependent on the association in different multisubunit complexes (PubMed:10026213, PubMed:11545749, PubMed:16543222, PubMed:16543223, PubMed:17189264). Functions as histone acetyltransferase component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA, SALSA and ADA (PubMed:10026213, PubMed:12186975, PubMed:9154821). SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes (PubMed:10026213). At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery (PubMed:10026213). It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8) (PubMed:10026213). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac) (PubMed:10026213). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs) (PubMed:10026213). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation (PubMed:12186975). The ADA histone acetyltransferase complex preferentially acetylates nucleosomal histones H3 (to form H3K14ac and H3K18ac) and H2B, leading to transcription regulation (PubMed:9154821). SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA (PubMed:12446794, PubMed:15647753). It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus (PubMed:15647753). In addition to histone acetyltransferase, can use different acyl-CoA substrates, such as (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA) and is able to mediate histone crotonylation (PubMed:31699900). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10026213, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11545749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12186975, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12446794, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15647753, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17189264, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19822662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31699900, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9154821}."

TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8).

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH6 provides substrate-binding and substrate specificity to the complex. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. Acts mainly to repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication, but can also repair longer insertion-deletion loops (IDLs), although with decreasing efficiency as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis by the MutS alpha complex is crucial for MMR. Both subunits bind ATP, but with differing affinities, and their ATPase kinetics are also very different. MSH6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, whereas MSH2 catalyzes ATP at a substantially slower rate. Binding to a mismatched base pair suppresses MSH6-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, but not the activity of MSH2. ATP binding to both subunits is necessary to trigger a change in MutS alpha interaction with mismatched DNA, converting MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent movement along DNA, and also facilitates formation of ternary complexes containing MutS and MutL proteins and the mismatch. May also be involved in resolution of recombination intermediates. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10518225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10970737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12820877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15811858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16214425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16337600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16407100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16600868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17141577, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17567610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17573527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8600025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9111357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9545323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9770499}."

SEC13 is directly or indirectly required for normal ER membrane and nuclear envelope morphology. It also functions as a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). NPC components, collectively referred to as nucleoporins (NUPs), can play the role of both NPC structural components and of docking or interaction partners for transiently associated nuclear transport factors. SEC13 is required for efficient mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and for correct nuclear pore biogenesis and distribution.

Aldehydes exhibited 50-12000 times higher catalytic efficiency than the corresponding alcohols, therefore the major function of the enzyme is as an aldehyde reductase. The enzyme is active towards aromatic and aliphatic (linear and branched-chain) aldehydes. The enzyme is very active towards aromatic aldehydes, such as cinnamaldehyde, benzaldehyde and substituted benzaldehydes, such as veratraldehyde and panisaldehyde. It exhibits low activity towards substituted cinnamaldehydes, such as coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde. The enzyme has no activity with ketones, such as acetone or cyclohexanone. For the reverse reaction, linear and branched-chain primary alcohols are substrates, whereas very low activity is found with secondary alcohols, such as butan-2-ol (PubMed:11742541). The enzyme may be physiologically involved in several steps of the lignin degradation pathway, initiated by other microorganisms, in the synthesis of fusel alcohols, products derived from the aminoacidic metabolism, and in the homeostasis of NADP(H) (Probable).

HEL2 is activated when ribosomes are stalled within an mRNA following translation of prematurely polyadenylated mRNAs (PubMed:28757607). Acts as a ribosome collision sensor: specifically recognizes and binds collided ribosome and ubiquitinates the 40S ribosomal proteins RPS20/uS10 and RPS3/uS3 (PubMed:30609991, PubMed:31819057, PubMed:32615089, PubMed:32203490).

The RQC pathway functions as a preventive quality control in the secretory pathway: HEL2 binds preferentially to the pre-engaged secretory ribosome-nascent chain complexes and prevents mistargeting of secretory proteins into mitochondria (PubMed:33761353).

Its role in cellular physiology is to improve mitochondrial performance (By similarity). CL is critical for the coassembly of lipids and proteins in mitochondrial membranes, for instance, remodeling of the acyl groups of CL in the mitochondrial inner membrane affects the assembly and stability of respiratory chain complex IV and its supercomplex forms (PubMed:16135531). Catalyzes the transacylation between phospholipids and lysophospholipids, with the highest rate being between phosphatidylcholine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or PC) and CL. Catalyzes both 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lysophosphatidylcholine or LPC) reacylation and PC-CL transacylation, that means, it exchanges acyl groups between CL and PC by a combination of forward and reverse transacylations. Also catalyzes transacylations between other phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or PE) and CL, between PC and PE, and between PC and phosphatidate (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate or PA), although at lower rate. Not regiospecific, it transfers acyl groups into any of the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), which is an important prerequisite for uniformity and symmetry in CL acyl distribution. Cannot transacylate dilysocardiolipin (DLCL), thus, the role of MLCL is limited to that of an acyl acceptor (By similarity). CoA-independent, it can reshuffle molecular species within a single phospholipid class (PubMed:15588229). Redistributes fatty acids between MLCL, CL, and other lipids, which prolongs the half-life of CL. Its action is completely reversible, which allows for cyclic changes, such as fission and fusion or bending and flattening of the membrane. Hence, by contributing to the flexibility of the lipid composition, it plays an important role in the dynamics of mitochondria membranes.

Has several distinct roles in protecting genome stability by resolving diverse forms of deleterious DNA structures. Component of the SLX1-SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease that resolves DNA secondary structures generated during DNA repair and recombination. Has endonuclease activity towards branched DNA substrates, introducing single-strand cuts in duplex DNA close to junctions with ss-DNA. Has a preference for simple Y, 5'-flap and replication fork-like structures. It cleaves the strand bearing the 5'-non-homologous arm at the branch site junction and generates ligatable, nicked products from the 5'-flap or replication fork substrates. Plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci, where it has a role in re-starting stalled replication forks. Has Holliday junction resolvase activity in vitro. Interacts with the structure-specific RAD1-RAD10 endonuclease and promotes RAD1-RAD10-dependent 3'-non-homologous tail removal (NHTR) during repair of double-strand breaks by single-strand annealing. SLX4 also promotes recovery from DNA-alkylation-induced replisome stalling during DNA replication by facilitating the error-free mode of lesion bypass.

ERG27 is a catalytic component of the C-4 demethylation complex that catalyze the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:10535978). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10535978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12119386, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12842197, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15995173, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}.; FUNCTION: Facilitates the association of ERG7 with lipid particles preventing its digestion in the endoplasmic reticulum and the lipid particles. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12842197}."

Thereby, frees 60S subunit ribosomes from the stalled translation complex and prevents the accumulation of nascent polypeptide chains that are potentially toxic for the cell (PubMed:23178123). Within the RQC complex, RQC2 specifically binds stalled 60S ribosomal subunits by recognizing an exposed, nascent chain-conjugated tRNA moiety and promotes the recruitment of RKR1/LTN1 to stalled 60S subunits (PubMed:23479637, PubMed:25349383). Following binding to stalled 60S ribosomal subunits, RQC2 mediates CAT tailing by recruiting alanine- and threonine-charged tRNA to the A-site and directing the elongation of stalled nascent chains independently of mRNA or 40S subunits, leading to non-templated C-terminal Ala and Thr extensions (CAT tails) (PubMed:25554787, PubMed:27129255, PubMed:26934223, PubMed:28751611, PubMed:32934225, PubMed:36804914). CAT tails promote the RKR1/LTN1-mediated ubiquitination of incompletely synthesized nascent polypeptides: CAT tailing facilitates RKR1/LTN1-dependent ubiquitination by exposing lysine residues that would otherwise remain buried in the ribosomal exit tunnel (PubMed:32934225, PubMed:28751611). Following ubiquitination, incompletely synthesized nascent polypeptides are recognized by CDC48 and degraded by the proteasome (PubMed:27129255). CAT-tailed proteins tend to aggregate and sequester chaperones and can induce proteotoxic stress; their RKR1/LTN1-dependent ubiquitination and degradation is required to prevent proteotoxic stress (PubMed:27129255, PubMed:26934223, PubMed:31133701). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20691087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23178123, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23479637, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25349383, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25554787, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26934223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27129255, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28751611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31133701, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32934225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36804914}."

The transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). Within the SAGA complex, participates in a subcomplex with SGF11, SGF73 and UBP8 required for deubiquitination of H2B and for the maintenance of steady-state H3 methylation levels. The TREX-2 complex functions in docking export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) to the nuclear entrance of the nuclear pore complex (nuclear basket), by association with components of the nuclear mRNA export machinery (MEX67-MTR2 and SUB2) in the nucleoplasm and the nucleoporin NUP1 at the nuclear basket. TREX-2 participates in mRNA export and accurate chromatin positioning in the nucleus by tethering genes to the nuclear periphery. SUS1 has also a role in mRNP biogenesis and maintenance of genome integrity through preventing RNA-mediated genome instability. Has a role in response to DNA damage induced by methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and replication arrest induced by hydroxyurea.

REP1-REP2 are required to recruit the cohesin complex to the STB locus for pairing of the replicated plasmid cluster, a prerequisite for successful plasmid segregation. REP1-REP2 also negatively regulate expression of site-specific recombinase FLP and of RAF1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10791970, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177044, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16966420, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2832156}."

ERG8 converts 5-phosphomevalonate to 5-diphosphomevalonate (PubMed:1846667). The second module is carried out in the vacuole and involves the formation of farnesyl diphosphate, which is also an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, dolichol, heme and prenylated proteins. Activity by the mevalonate kinase ERG12 first converts mevalonate into 5-phosphomevalonate. 5-phosphomevalonate is then further converted to 5-diphosphomevalonate by the phosphomevalonate kinase ERG8. The diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase MVD1/ERG19 then produces isopentenyl diphosphate. The isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase IDI1 then catalyzes the 1,3-allylic rearrangement of the homoallylic substrate isopentenyl (IPP) to its highly electrophilic allylic isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Finally the farnesyl diphosphate synthase ERG20 catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, and then with the resultant geranylpyrophosphate to the ultimate product farnesyl pyrophosphate (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1846667, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.5). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|Ref.5, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor the catalytic components of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis. Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core. In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol. 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3. ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:32679672). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11160377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12119386, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15522820, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15995173, ECO:0000303|PubMed:32679672}."

First, a [2Fe-2S] cluster is transiently assembled on the scaffold proteins ISU1 and ISU2. In a second step, the cluster is released from ISU1/ISU2, transferred to glutaredoxin GRX5, followed by the formation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins, the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their target-specific insertion into the recipient apoproteins. Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH. Fe-S cluster release from ISU1/ISU2 is achieved by interaction with the Hsp70 chaperone SSQ1, assisted by the DnaJ-like co-chaperone JAC1 and the nucleotide exchange factor MGE1 (PubMed:23615440). ISU1 is the major isoform in yeast, while ISU2 is not detectable in cells grown to stationary phase (By similarity).
