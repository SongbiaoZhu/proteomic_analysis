Erg31 and erg32 catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (By similarity). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P32353, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

Erg5 converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (By similarity). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P54781, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

Erg31 and erg32 catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (By similarity). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable).

Erg9 produces squalene from 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties (PubMed:8474436). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8474436, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins smb1, smd1, smd2, smd3, sme1, smf1 and smg1 that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core) (By similarity). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins smd1, smd2, sme1, smf1 and smg1 (5Sm) are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone saf5 that controls the assembly of the core snRNP (By similarity). To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from saf5 forming an intermediate (By similarity).

Erg1 catalyzes the epoxidation of squalene into 2,3-epoxysqualene (PubMed:33223513). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:33223513, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators, and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (gcn5) and deubiquitination (ubp8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3. ADA preferentially acetylates nucleosomal histones H3 (to form H3K14ac and H3K18ac) and H2B (By similarity).

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators, and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (gcn5) and deubiquitination (ubp8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:18310029). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

Erg26 is a catalytic component of the C-4 demethylation complex that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group (By similarity). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain.

Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins smb1, smd1, smd2, smd3, sme1, smf1 and smg1 that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (By similarity).

Erg4 catalyzes the last step of ergosterol biosynthesis by converting ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol into ergosterol (PubMed:8125337, PubMed:18310029). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8125337, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

Erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (By similarity). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P32352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

Erg7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (By similarity). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P38604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8604986, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

Required for selective autophagic degradation of the nucleus (nucleophagy) as well as for mitophagy which contributes to regulate mitochondrial quantity and quality by eliminating the mitochondria to a basal level to fulfill cellular energy requirements and preventing excess ROS production (By similarity). The protease activity is required for proteolytic activation of atg8: cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of atg8 to reveal a C-terminal glycine (PubMed:23950735). Atg8 ubiquitin-like activity requires the exposure of the glycine at the C-terminus for its conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and its insertion to membranes, which is necessary for autophagy. The atg8-PE conjugate mediates tethering between adjacent membranes and stimulates membrane hemifusion, leading to expansion of the autophagosomal membrane during autophagy. In addition to the protease activity, also catalyzes deconjugation of PE-conjugated forms of atg8 during macroautophagy: atg8 delipidation is required to release the protein from membranes, which facilitates multiple events during macroautophagy, and especially for efficient autophagosome biogenesis, the assembly of atg9-containing tubulovesicular clusters into phagophores/autophagosomes, and for the disassembly of PAS-associated ATG components. Atg8 delipidation by atg4 also recycles atg8-PE generated on inappropriate membranes to maintain a reservoir of unlipidated atg8 that is required for autophagosome formation at the PAS (By similarity).

Erg25 is a catalytic component of the C-4 demethylation complex that catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols (By similarity). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P53045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15797383, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators, and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (gcn5) and deubiquitination (ubp8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q12030}."

Erg27 is a catalytic component of the C-4 demethylation complex that catalyze the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (By similarity). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol.

Erg28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor the catalytic components of the C-4 demethylation complex erg25, erg26 and erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:11160377). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Firstly, the squalene synthase erg9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids. Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable).

The 43S PIC binds to mRNA and scans downstream to the initiation codon, where it forms a 48S initiation complex by codon-anticodon base pairing. This leads to the displacement of eIF-1 to allow GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF-5-mediated hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP. Hydrolysis of GTP and release of Pi, which makes GTP hydrolysis irreversible, causes the release of the eIF-2-GDP binary complex from the 40S subunit, an event that is essential for the subsequent joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form an elongation-competent 80S ribosome.

Secondly, squalene is converted into lanosterol by the consecutive action of the squalene epoxidase erg1 and the lanosterol synthase erg7. The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11/cyp1 catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol. In the next steps, a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions catalyzed by the C-14 reductase erg24 and the C-4 demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 leads to the production of zymosterol. Erg28 likely functions in the C-4 demethylation complex reaction by tethering erg26 and Erg27 to the endoplasmic reticulum or to facilitate interaction between these proteins. Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase erg6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol. The C-8 sterol isomerase erg2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol. The sterol-C5-desaturases erg31 and erg32 then catalyze the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol. The C-22 sterol desaturase erg5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain. Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase erg4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:18310029) (Probable). In the genus Schizosaccharomyces, a second route exists between lanosterol and fecosterol, via the methylation of lanosterol to eburicol by erg6, followed by C14-demethylation by erg11/cyp1 and C4-demethylation by the demethylation complex erg25-erg26-erg27 (PubMed:8586261) (Probable). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P32462, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18310029, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8586261}."

The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (IMS) are transferred via the dinuclear copper A center (CU(A)) of subunit 2 and heme A of subunit 1 to the active site in subunit 1, a binuclear center (BNC) formed by heme A3 and copper B (CU(B)). The BNC reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules using 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the IMS and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04039}."

Thereby, frees 60S subunit ribosomes from the stalled translation complex and prevents the accumulation of nascent polypeptide chains that are potentially toxic for the cell. Within the RQC complex, mtr1/rqc2 specifically binds stalled 60S ribosomal subunits by recognizing an exposed, nascent chain-conjugated tRNA moiety and promotes the recruitment of rkr1/ltn1 to stalled 60S subunits. Following binding to stalled 60S ribosomal subunits, mtr1/rqc2 mediates CAT tailing by recruiting alanine- and threonine-charged tRNA to the A-site and directing the elongation of stalled nascent chains independently of mRNA or 40S subunits, leading to non-templated C-terminal Ala and Thr extensions (CAT tails). CAT tails promote the rkr1/ltn1-mediated ubiquitination of incompletely synthesized nascent polypeptides: CAT tailing facilitates rkr1/ltn1-dependent ubiquitination by exposing lysine residues that would otherwise remain buried in the ribosomal exit tunnel. Following ubiquitination, incompletely synthesized nascent polypeptides are recognized by CDC48 and degraded by the proteasome. CAT-tailed proteins tend to aggregate and sequester chaperones and can induce proteotoxic stress; their rkr1/ltn1-dependent ubiquitination and degradation is required to prevent proteotoxic stress. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q12532}."

The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P0C2H7}."

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators, and chromatin modification through histone acetylation and deubiquitination. SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}."
